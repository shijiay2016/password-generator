# password-generator
- Built as part of the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp**
- The objective is to take the inputs from the user to these questions and then generate a random password. 

# What I learned
- Learned how to use lists to store multiple items (letters, numbers, symbols).
- Practiced using random.choice() and random.shuffle() to generate and mix random elements.
- Used for loops and range() to repeat actions a specific number of times.
- Learned how to take user input with input() and convert it to an integer using int().
- Practiced list operations like append() to add items.
- Learned how to combine list elements into a string using a loop or "".join().
- Understood basic program flow — input → process → output.
- Improved logical thinking by breaking a big task into smaller steps.

# How to run
